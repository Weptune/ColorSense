ColorSense is a Python-based tool for analyzing and enhancing videos through emotion-driven color grading.
Designed for filmmakers, content creators, and visual storytellers, it analyzes the color palette of a video, predicts its emotional tone (or lets you select one), and automatically applies a color grading effect to better match or enhance that emotion.
